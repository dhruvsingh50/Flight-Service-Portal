	Payment by debit cards will not incur a surcharge.<br />

	Online credit card payment sometimes get declined for the following reasons:<br />
	a) Entering incorrect card details including card number and last 3 digit code.<br />
	b) Incorrect Card validity dates <br />
	c) Foreign credit cards where dept date is not from and to UK destination points. <br />
	d) Not enough funds in your account to pay for the air tickets.<br />
	Sometimes online card payments can be pre-authorised but it is then rejected by our bank and automatically the transaction is voided for a number of reasons. You will receive email confirmation that your payment has been unsuccessful to confirm this. In these circumstances , you will find after checking with your bank that the funds has been authorised for payment from your account. However, in this situation, Omega Flightstore has not received any payment into its bank account because it has rejected the transaction. The monies are therefore frozen by your payment card and then it is automatically returned to your payment account within 3-5 working days. For foreign bank cards the process can take longer than 3-5 working days.<br /><br />
	If your monies are not returned to your payment card within 3-5 working days , please contact our customer service department. We will require your card number together with the transaction ID from your bank . This will enable us to contact our bank requesting to pre-authorise the release of the frozen funds back to your payment card account. For customers who refuse to cooperate in this matter , we can only assume that this is a potential fraud case which the traveler concerned is using someone else’s payment card.</span></span></p>

	<span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif;color:#474646;font-size:14px;">Airlines have different rules regarding the upper limit beyond which they would permit a pregnant woman to fly.<br />
	As a general guide, almost all airlines decline to fly a woman beyond 36 weeks of gestation. In the phase between 28-36 weeks, most airlines will require that the passenger bring her doctor’s letter stating that she is fit to fly and unlikely to go into labour within 36 hours. The cut off points for a woman carrying twins is likely to be much lower. We advise all expectant mothers to check with your GP before making any travel plans and to provide us with a written confirmation of your pregnancy and your GP’s letter as detailed above which will be acknowledged in writing by us. <br />
	This will be passed to the airline so that you may be permitted to board the flight without any hiccups. Without this confirmation and GP’s letter in place, you may still be issued with travel documents but we cannot guarantee you will be permitted to fly. As travel agents, we tend to take the word of the passenger as truth when it comes to disclosure of any material fact that may affect the passenger’s booking including if a female passenger is pregnant and how far along in the pregnancy she is. The travel agency places trust in the pregnant passenger to adhere to the Terms &amp; Conditions and disclose the fact of her pregnancy at time of or before booking. <br />
	In all cases of special or other requests, please remember that in most cases, the booking is made online or over the telephone and we do not get to meet you.<br/>
	Without meeting you, we cannot establish any material fact as to your disability or pregnancy or other special condition which may or may not be apparent physically.<br/>
	We, therefore, require you to disclose any such facts that may affect your booking to us.</span><strong><u></u></strong><br />
